    "text": "Literature search\nTo get the gist for the current state of the field, we searched the Web of Science for published journal articles that examined whether animals tolerated, preferred or avoided inbreeding. The following search string was used to search for studies published between the 1st of January 2020 to the 1st of February 2025: TS=(“inbreeding tolerance”) OR TS=(“inbreeding preference”) OR TS=(“inbreeding avoidance”). Query link: https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/summary/e4d61622-9f6b-48f1-b954-83c598431347-014b923814/relevance/1 This search criteria identified 188 studies. We were unable to access two studies and we removed a third from our full-text screen because it was not a journal article.\nFrom this initial list, we identified 121 studies where the authors stated whether they expected inbreeding preference, tolerance or avoidance to be present in their system. Of these, 78 had clear, evolutionary-driven hypotheses regarding inbreeding. These 78 studies were retained for analysis.\nTo download our reference list you can either download a .csv from the Tables below, get it directly from the source repository or go to our Open Science Network repository."
