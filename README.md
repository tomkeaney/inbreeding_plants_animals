# inbreeding_plants_animals

This repository hosts all the files required to re-run the analysis presented in "Why zoologists shouldnâ€™t treat the automatic transmission advantage as an afterthought", published in the _Journal of Evolutionary Biology_ (DOI here). We recommend that you visit https://tomkeaney.github.io/inbreeding_plants_animals/ for all details on our literature search, a readme type description for our dataset, and the code for our quick statistical analysis.

To re-run our analysis, only two files are needed: our raw data `inbreeding_adaptive_refs.csv` and our R code file `lit_analysis.qmd`. All other files are only neccessary to build the [quarto pages website](https://tomkeaney.github.io/inbreeding_plants_animals/) linked to in the above paragraph.
